# Machine Learning

This repository contains the solutions for the assignments from the 'Machine Learning' course (ECE579) taken at Worcester Polytechnic Institute - WPI in the Fall 2019. The repository includes 6 projects, namely:

1 - Linear Regression: maximum likelihood (least square). </br>
2 - SVM (Support Vector Machine): linear kernel. </br>
3 - KNN (k-nearest neighbors). </br>
4 - Multilayer Perceptron for MNIST classification. </br>
5 - Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network. </br>
6 - Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). </br>
